# Professional Algorithm Example: Using Collections.binarySearch

This repository contains a professional example of using `Collections.binarySearch` with a custom object and comparator. The example demonstrates how to:

- Define a custom object (`Person`).
- Create a custom comparator.
- Sort a list of custom objects.
- Use `Collections.binarySearch` to find an element in the sorted list.
- Handle the search result, including the insertion point when the element is not found.

## Overview

In this example, we define a simple `Person` class that contains a `name` and `age`. We use a custom comparator based on the `name` field to sort a list of `Person` objects. Then, we perform a binary search using `Collections.binarySearch` to locate a `Person` by name.

This example is suitable for senior Java developers who want to understand how to effectively use binary search with custom objects in modern Java.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
